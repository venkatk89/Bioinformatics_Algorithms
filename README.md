# Bioinformatics_Algorithms
A repo containing Python and R codes for algorithms used in bioinformatics.

## Contents

### Shell files
- ```find_genomic_regions_length.sh``` Code to extract the sizes of different functional regions of a genome from a GTF file. 


### R files

- ```add_rsids_to_variants.R``` Code that adds RSIDS to variants present in a text file (IDs taken from the dbsnp database or any vcf file).
- ```transcriptomics_tutorial.R``` Basic differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2 (with code for volcano plot with ggplo2)


### Python files

- ```bioinformatics_tools.py```, ```bio_structures.py```, ```algorithmic_tools.py``` have functions to perform various basic tasks in bioinformatics (description is present for each function in the comment block). Use ```main.py``` to access the respective function.
